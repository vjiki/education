#### **HashMap with limited values number**

Our data structure is called MyMultiMap. It's parametrized with generics, extends HashMap and implements
Cloneable and Serializable interfaces. The only feature is that the constructor takes an argument as input: 
* int repeatCount - limited number of values per key   

Implement methods.
